yt-dl is a simple no frill mp3 downloader from youtube at 128kps aacc codec.


Using node.js I attempt to do get mp3 off youtube video using ytdl-core and ffmpeg to get 128kps mp3 at the end.
Will work on error and edge cases as well as improving user interface.

Later will add the ability to add cookies to download higher res as well
User interface with websockets
More user friendly page interface and error processing



Currently deployed on Render: https://youtube-mp3-r0m0.onrender.com/
only frontend is working since Render does not allow file download ... but working on VSS using node server.js command.
